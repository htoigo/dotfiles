# .zshrc --- ZSH configuration for interactive shells.

# Any settings that will not confuse dumb terminals go here.

# ...

# Dumb terminal bailout:
#
# If a dumb terminal is connecting, disable ZLE, set a very simple prompt and
# abort before we do any fancy setup which activates things like escape
# sequences for clorized output, right-hand side prompt, etc.
#
# This includes Emacs Tramp, which sets $TERM to 'dumb'. Emacs Tramp needs to
# recognize the shell prompt (via regex search) for accurate parsing of shell
# responses. Escape sequences for coloring and other fancy stuff such as zsh
# line editor's (ZLE) right-hand side prompts (gasp!) seriously confuse Tramp
# and can prevent it from connecting.

[[ $TERM = "dumb" ]] && unsetopt zle && PROMPT='> ' && return
