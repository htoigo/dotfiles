# Function to convert msdos text file line endings to unix line endings.
# Given no arguments, it filters stdin to stdout.
# Otherwise, each argument is the name of a file to be converted in place.

if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
  # filter mode; use stdin & stdout
  sed -e 's/\r$//'
else
  # filename(s) were entered, convert each file in-place
  sed -i~ -e 's/\r$//' "$@"
